# Welcome to the Creative Tech Stack newsletter!

## Why?

90% of my media consumption is tech updates*, tech/AI/ML white papers, virtual production techniques, and I'm a creative technologist at a creative agency. My notes and photos app is full of random stuff I find and I want to organise it better.

I give monthly keynotes about emerging tech based on my notes to a bunch of creatives and technologists, so I thought I should make them into a proper resource.

> *Before you ask, the remaining 10% is doom scrolling Rory Sutherland clips and kitchen gadgets.

## What I'll be posting

I'll cover areas of interest for a Creative Technologist in the creative industry. You can see what that can look like [here on my personal blog](https://www.jonothan.dev/things/becoming-a-creative-technologist).

## Will others post?

Sick idea! Hopefully. Gonna make this whole thing open source (the newsletter and lists are hardcoded in JSON and MDX instead of a database), so it should be easy for others to add stuff!

## Will this be emailed?

If people are interested. If you are one of them, register here:
