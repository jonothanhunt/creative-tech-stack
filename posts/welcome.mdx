# Welcome to the Creative Tech Stack newsletter!

## Why and what for?

Right now, my notes app is full of random stuff I've found and I wanted to organise it better.

I give monthly keynotes covering emerging tech based on my notes to a bunch of creatives, so I thought I should make them into a proper resource.

## The tech stack(s) I'll be covering

I work at a creative agency, so there's a lot going on with Generative AI for ideation and production from simple agents, to complex agentic production workflows.

A lot of what I build is on the web or uses the web stack.

## What's next?

Contrary to the implication of the title, this thing is not yet being emailed to anyone, though if you'd like that, please register your interest here:
