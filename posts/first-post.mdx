# Welcome to the Creative Tech Newsletter

## Why and what for?

I'm subscribed to SO many newsletters, blogs, channels and release notes — both because I'm a tech-head, but also because as a Creative Tech, I'm always creating with the latest and emerging tech, giving keynotes and workshops, and generally being asked for advice.



## The tech stack(s) I'll be covering

I work at a creative agency, so there's a lot going on with Generative AI for ideation and production — all the way from basic image gen to complex visual and audio production workflows involving multi-modal and agentic setups. To that end, I'll be covering various platforms and technologies in the space.

A lot of what I build is on or uses the web and often via React / Next.js.

There are a few libraries I particularly love, React Three Fiber, TensorFlow.js

## What's next?

Contrary to the implication of the title, this thing is not yet being emailed to anyone, though if you'd like that, please register your interest here:
